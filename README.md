# Remote Repository Mapper

A Jetbrains plugin that opens a local file in a remote repository.

## Install

## Usage

After installing select your remote repository provider in Settings -> Other Settings -> Remote Repository Mapper (Defaults to GitHub).
Open a file that is under git version control in the editor and select File->Open in remote repository.
The current checked out branch is used unless it does not track a remote branch, in which case it defaults to using master.
The resulting link can be copied to the clipboard depending on your preference in the settings.
